Iâ€™m a 4th-year undergraduate student at KAIST, pursuing BS in mathematical sciences and computer science as a double major. My interest range over the whole field of ML/DL, with emphasis on theoretical aspects of various ML/DL algorithms and related mathematical theories.
Currently, I'm working with two research groups in KAIST: Prof. [Se-Young Yun](https://fbsqkd.github.io/)'s [OSI Lab](http://osi.kaist.ac.kr/), and Prof. Chang Dong Yoo's [AIM Lab](https://slsp.kaist.ac.kr/xe/) with Prof. Gwangsu Kim.
Previously, I've collaborated with [Cheolhyoung Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/cheolhyounglee)

I'm currently a first violinist at the KAIST Orchestra, where my passion for classical music is freely expressed.

When my life feels very complicated, I play Overwatch ;)
