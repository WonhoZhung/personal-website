Iâ€™m an undergraduate researcher at KAIST, pursuing BSc in mathematical sciences and computer science as double major. My interests range over the whole field of ML/DL with emphasis on theoretical aspects of ML/DL + related mathematical theories, and their various applications. My other interests include, but are not limited to, probabilistic(Bayesian) ML/DL, graphs, fairness issues arising from ML/DL.

Currently, I'm working with four research groups in KAIST: Prof. [Se-Young Yun](https://fbsqkd.github.io/)'s [OSI Lab](http://osi.kaist.ac.kr/), Prof. Chang Dong Yoo's [AIM Lab](https://slsp.kaist.ac.kr/xe/) with Prof. Gwangsu Kim, Prof. Shin Yoo's [COINSE Lab](https://coinse.kaist.ac.kr/), and Prof. [Jae Kyoung Kim](mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/~jaekkim/)'s [BIMAG](www.ibs.re.kr/bimag/).

I'm a violinist at the KAIST Orchestra, where my passion for classical music is freely expressed.
