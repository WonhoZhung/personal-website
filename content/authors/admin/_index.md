Iâ€™m an undergraduate researcher at KAIST, pursuing BSc in mathematical sciences and computer science as double major. My interests range over the whole field of ML/DL with emphasis on their theoretical aspects + related mathematical theories, and their various applications. My other interests include, but are not limited to, probabilistic(Bayesian) ML/DL, graphs, algorithmic fairness, "other" areas of mathematics.

I'm a violinist at the KAIST Orchestra, where my passion for classical music is freely expressed.
