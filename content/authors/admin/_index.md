Iâ€™m a undergraduate researcher at KAIST, pursuing BS in mathematical sciences and computer science as double major. My interests range over the whole field of ML/DL, with emphasis on theoretical aspects of various ML/DL algorithms + related mathematical theories, and their various applications. Recently, I've been also interested in fairness issues arising from ML/DL.

Currently, I'm part of three research groups in KAIST: Prof. [Se-Young Yun](https://fbsqkd.github.io/)'s [OSI Lab](http://osi.kaist.ac.kr/), Prof. Chang Dong Yoo's [AIM Lab](https://slsp.kaist.ac.kr/xe/) with Prof. Gwangsu Kim, and Prof. Shin Yoo's [COINSE Lab](https://coinse.kaist.ac.kr/).

I'm a violinist at the KAIST Orchestra, where my passion for classical music is freely expressed.
